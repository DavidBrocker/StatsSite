Research in psychology encompasses several fields and sub-fields, however, each area adheres to the same rigorous methodological constraints.

This lecture explains the concept of operationalization, or how we selectively define certain attributes or concepts. We will also discuss the different scales of measurements; nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio

<summary>**Lecture 2: Operationalization \| Scales of Measurement**</summary>

This lecture introduces the concept of Central Tendency and some statistical tools we use to measure these such as Mean, Median, Mode, and Range.

<summary>**Lecture 3: Measures of Central Tendency**</summary>

In this lecture, we will discuss how 'real' data is often unwieldy and will varyâ€“it is the magnitude of *how* much the data varies that determines our statistical decisions. We will be introduced to the statistical concepts of variance and standard deviation.

<summary>**Lecture 4: Measures of Variability**</summary>

This lecture introduces the concept of standardization using z-scores and probability to determine the likelihood of some data decisions.

This lecture discusses the notion of sampling and how we draw portions from the unknown population to test hypotheses and make generalizations (when possible) about larger groups.

The statistical concepts of Power and Effect Size will be discussed as well as seeing a crucial step in the research cycle, Meta-Analysis which analyzes the analyses of past papers.

<summary>**Lecture 11: Power & Effect Size \| Introduction to Meta-Analysis**</summary>

[Reading](https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/12-Thinking.html#power)

</details>

<details>

This lecture discusses the how two or more variables change in accordance with the other as well as how we define the strength, and direction of a relationship between measured variables.

<summary>**Lecture 12: Covariance & Correlation**</summary>

This lecture discusses the statistical framework of Linear Regression which can be used to create predictive models and inferences about what *might* occur given a certain set of information or variables.

<summary>**Lecture 13: Linear Regression**</summary>

This lecture explains how more than one variable can contribute to the strength of a relationship as well as the predictive value. Other *types* of variables can also be used to predict states.

The independent samples t-test is used to test for differences between two samples that come from independent sources.

<summary>**Lecture 17: Independent Samples t-Tests**</summary>

<details>

The Between Subjects ANOVA is used when an Independent Variable has more than three levels and each level is composed of unique respondents.

<summary>**Lecture 18: Between Subjects ANOVA**</summary>

<details>

When interpreting the results of an ANOVA, you can use comparisons to test how the effects differ between each of the 3+ conditions.

<summary>**Lecture 19: Comparisons**</summary>

</details>

<details>

A Factorial ANOVA has 2 or more Independent Variables which leads you with possible Main Effects for each Independent Variable as well as an interaction effect *between* each independent Variable.

<summary>**Lecture 20: Factorial ANOVA**</summary>

[Reading](https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/09-FactorialANOVA.html)

</details>

<details>

Factorial ANOVA's have the possibility for an interaction where the effect of a manipulation is *especially* powerful in the presence of a certain level of a secondary independent variable *or* the effect *depends* on a certain level of a secondary independent variable.

<summary>**Lecture 21: Interactions in ANOVA**</summary>

<details>

A Within-Subjects ANOVA uses the same participants in each level of an independent variable.

<summary>**Lecture 22: Within Subjects ANOVA**</summary>

[Reading](https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/08-RMANOVA.html)

</details>

<details>

Mixed Method ANOVA's can have a variety of Between and Within Factors that contribute to the research design. Some respondents are exposed to one type of level within an independent variable, however, *all* participants are exposed to one or more conditions of a secondary independent variable.

Reliability and Validity are statistical concepts that establish criteria for independent and dependent variables as well as classifications for internal strength of a certain measure or test.
