## Review

-   68.3% of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within 1 SD of the mean.

-   95.4% of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within 2 SD of the mean.

-   99.7% of the datapoints (the X's) will fall within 3 SD of the mean.

Z-scores are expressed in Standard Deviation units.

## Z-scores

Z-scores re-express the original data points (the X's) in a way that intuitively lets us know:

-   How close the X is to the mean

-   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution

-   how much this participant is like the other person in the sample

-   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution

-   how different this participant is from the majority of people in the sample

## Z-scores

### Z-scores are expressed in Standard Deviation units.

-   z = 1

-   z = -2

-   z = 0.5

## Calculating A Z-score

-   Mean-center the X values ---\> X --- X ---\> Makes the Mean = 0.

-   Dividing by the standard deviation ---\> Makes the SD = 1.

How do we calculate the probability of an outcome, using the normal distribution?

-   Use a z-score:

-   Mean center the X values.

-   Divide them by the SD.

## How do we calculate the probability of an outcome, using the normal distribution?

-   The average grade on the exam was an 86 with a standard deviation of 4.

-   What is the probability of scoring a 94 or higher on the exam?

$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

$z = \frac{94-86}{4} = \frac{8}{4}=2$

$z = 2$

-   Z = 2 corresponds with 2.1% and 0.1% of the curve 2.2% chance.

## Example 2

### The mean exam score was 86 with a standard deviation of 4.

What is the probability of scoring between an 82 and a 90?

$z = \frac{82-86}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$

$z = \frac{90-86}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$

-   68.3% chance of scoring between 82 and 90.

## Example 3

> Esmeralda's stats professor tells her class that the average score on the exam was a 72 with a standard deviation of 6, and the distribution of scores was normal.

Esmeralda wants to calculate the probability that she scored below 60

$\frac{60-72}{6} = \frac{-12}{6} = -2$

-   2.2% chance that she failed.

-   What's the chance she passed?

## Z-scores and Probability

In real life, we are often working with numbers with long decimal points rather than nice whole numbers.

-   Because the standard normal curve is STANDARD and NORMAL, we can calculate the exact probability of a z-score with a decimal point.

-   Calculate the z-score.

-   Locate the whole number and first decimal point along the left side of the table.

-   Locate the second decimal point along the top of the table.

## Z-scores and Probability

The Z-score Probability Table gives you the probability of that z-score or **LESS**.

-   If you need that z-score or higher, you have to subtract the decimal from 1.

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Some examples

> In a recent study on world happiness, participants were asked to evaluate their current lives on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the worst possible life and 10 represents the best possible life. The responses were normally distributed, with a mean of 5.4 and a standard deviation of 2.2. Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

-   Less than 4

-   More than 8

The responses were **normally distributed**, with a mean of **5.4** and a standard deviation of **2.2**. Find the probability that a randomly selected study participant's response was:

-   Less than 4

-   More than 8

$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

$z = \frac{4-5.4}{2.2} = \frac{-1.4}{2.2} = -.63$

## Z-scores and Probability:

### Example 2

> The scale of scores for an IQ test are approximately normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. The organization MENSA, which calls itself the "high IQ society", requires a score of 130 or higher.

What percent of adults would qualify for membership?


### Example 2

> The scale of scores for an IQ test are approximately normal with mean **100** and standard deviation **15**. The organization MENSA, which calls itself the "high IQ society", requires a score of 130 or higher.

What percent of adults would qualify for membership?

$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

$z = \frac{130-100}{15}=\frac{30}{15} = 2$
