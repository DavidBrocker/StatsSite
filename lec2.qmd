## Studying Psychology

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## Operationalization

The process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable (AKA a latent variable) though its existence is implied by other phenomena.

## Self-report

## Self-Report

### What's wrong with this?

![](images/SURV.png)

## Self-Report:

### Advantages

-   Most popular method of assessing attitudes\*

-   Can obtain large amounts of data

-   (Fairly) Quick

-   Allows for adaptive testing

-   (Fairly) Inexpensive

::: aside
In certain fields
:::

## Self-Report:

### Disadvantages

Acquiescence

:   -   Tendency to say yes, true, agree

Social desirability

:   -   Tendency to respond in ways that are seen as socially acceptable

Demand characteristics

:   -   Tendency to response in ways that participant thinks researcher wants

## Self-report:

### Avoiding Disadvantages

<details>

Anonymous respondents are less likely to make things up

<summary>Assure anonymity</summary>

</details>

<details>

Allow respondents to answer in private

<summary>Allow for maximum privacy</summary>

</details>

<details>

Don't make your experiment too obvious/revealing

<summary>Obscure the true goal of the experiment</summary>

</details>

<details>

Add questions that test for respondent awareness

<summary>Include attention checks</summary>

</details>

<details>

Purposely make some questions opposite

<summary>Reverse coding</summary>

## Behavioral Measures

-   Taking a flier

-   Signing a petition

-   Internet Behavior [^1]

-   Moving a chair

-   Donating money

## Observation

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## The Bobo Doll Experiment

### (Bandura, 1961)

-   Live aggression by adult

-   Videotaped aggression by adult

-   Cartoon aggression

    -   No aggression

## Observation

### Disadvantages

-   Time consuming

-   Different reviewers/observers may score behaviors differently.

    -   Coding scheme

        -   *Who* decides what is an example of the behavior?

    -   Inter-rater Reliability

        -   How much *agreement* is there between 2+ observers?

## Implicit measures

### Brain activity

## Issues with Operationalization

### Why is it hard to measure psychological phenomena?

-   Others may choose to measure the phenomena differently from us

-   Operationalization can be culture-specific

-   What we measure is based on observable parts of the phenomena, but some parts may be unobservable

    -   Measuring only the observable/reportable is imprecise

## Operationalization

### How should we measure aggression in children?

-   Observer children for one hour and...

    -   **Label** them as Aggressive or Non-Aggressive

    -   **Rank** them from most aggressive to least aggressive

    -   **Score** them on a 10-point scale.

        -   1 = No Aggression

        -   10 = All of the Aggression

    -   **Count** number of aggressive behaviors

## Scales of measurement

### A Scale By Any Other Name

-   ~~**Labels**~~ Nominal

-   ~~**Rank**~~ Order

-   ~~**Scale**~~ Interval

-   ~~**Count**~~ Ratio

## Measurement scales: Nominal

### Qualitative

*Nominal refers to categories that CANNOT be ordered:*

-   Condition (experimental, control)

-   Gender

-   Major in college

-   Coffee drinker versus Non-coffee drinker

-   Android User or iPhone User

## Measurement scales: Ordinal

### Quantiative, No Equal Steps

*Ordinal refers to categories that CAN be ordered, but the space between each category isn't the same:*

-   Olympic Medals

-   Winner in a Race

-   Your rank in this class

-   Your top 10 Movies

## Ordinal Scales

-   Rarely used in psychological research, because it is hard to calculate variance when the interval between each number differs.

-   There are non-parametric statistics designed for ordinal scales, but we will not be covering those this semester.

## Measurement scales: Interval

### Quantitative, Equal Distance, No True 0

*Interval refers to ratings that are ordered where the interval between each rating is the same, but there is no real "0."*

-   Temperature\*

-   "On a scale of 1-10 How much do you agree with the following statement..."

-   GPA

::: aside
Except for Kelvin!
:::

## Measurement scales: Ratio

### Quantitative, Equal Distance, No True 0

Ratio, refers to ratings that are ordered, the interval between each rating is the same, and "0" means "0."

-   Length

-   Reaction Time

-   Dosage

-   Money Donated

## Interval vs Ratio

### What's the difference between interval and ratio?

-   Interval may have a 0 on the scale, but it doesn't mean the absence of something. A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.

-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, "How many drinks did you have last night?"

## Discrete and Continous

### What's the Difference?

::: fragment
[Discrete variables]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"} have predefined values
:::

-   US States

-   Flavors of Ice Cream

::: fragment
[Continous Variables]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"} can occupy several different values
:::

-   Reaction Time

-   TV Ratings

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10. Researchers assess the relationship of undergraduates’ self-esteem and GPA.

-   Predictor variable: **Self-Esteem** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Outcome variable: **GPA** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Participants are given a mystery drug or placebo and then asked to complete puzzle tasks. Researchers time how long participants take to complete the puzzles.

-   Independent variable: Drug vs. Placebo \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Reaction Time \| [Continuous (Ratio)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

> Undergraduates are shown either pictures of death or pictures of landscapes. They then report their anxiety about aging on a scale of 1 (none) to 10 (lots).

-   Independent variable: Pictures of death versus landscapes \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

-   Dependent variable: Anxiety about dying \| [Continuous (Interval)]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

### For Science!

-   Statistical tests can only be run on specific scales of measurement.

-   t-test & ANOVA: Nominal IV/predictor and Continuous DV/outcome

-   Correlation & Regression: All continuous

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

-   Generally, continuous variables (interval and ratio scales) lend themselves better to statistical analysis.

-   As a researcher, you should plan out your statistical analysis BEFORE conducting your study, so that you measure your variables in a way that matches the type of analyses you will run.

## [TAKE AWAY]{.underline}: *How* we measure variables matters...

### because it dictates what kind of statistical analyses we can run.

-   Data can be coerced into different formats

-   'Correct' or 'Supporting' results can come from bogus data
