## STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION

### What do we know about normal distributions?

## Standard Normal Distribution

The 4 properties of a standard normal distribution are:

• They are shaped like a bell ("bell curve").

• They are symmetric.

• They are unimodal.

• The mean = median = mode.

::: calls
The mean, median, and mode are all the same in a normal distribution.

## Standard deviation

### **Standard deviation** is in the scale of the variable (x).

-   This means a standard deviation of 1 means a distance of 1 on the scale used to measure the variable.

## Standard Normal Distribution

-   Jonas scores a 98 on the exam. The average grade on the exam was 97 with a standard deviation of 1.

-   Find Jonas' score on the normal distribution.

-   Find Jonas' score on the normal distribution.

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Where do most scores fall in relation to the mean?

## Standard Normal Distribution

-   Most scores fall within one standard deviation of the mean.

-   "Within one standard deviation" means +1 as well as -1 standard deviation.

## Standard Normal Distribution

### 68.3% of scores fall within one standard deviation of the mean.

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Students' ratings of the Netflix Original *Dark* (range = 1- 10) form a normal distribution with m = 6 and s = 1.

-   What percentage of Students rate it a 7 or higher?

-   What percentage of Students rate it at least a 4?

-   What percentage of Students rate it an 8 or lower?

## Standard Normal Distribution

### Where should we put the mean?

![](images/bell_prop.png){fig-align="center"}

\[Insert Mean of 6\]

## Standard Normal Distribution

![](images/bell_prop.png){fig-align="center"}

\[Insert 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\]

\[Insert -3s -2s .etc\]

## Standard Normal Distribution

Students' ratings of the Netflix Original *Dark* form a normal distribution with m = 6 and s = 1.

-   What percentage of Students rate the Eric Andre Show a 7 or higher?

    -   15.8%

-   What percentage of Students rate the Eric Andre Show at least a 4?

    -   2.2%

-   What percentage of Students rate the Eric Andre Show an 8 or lower?

    -   97.6%

## Z-scores

A z-score tells you in standard deviation units how far the x-value is from the mean.

-   Z-scores are better than using raw SD, because when the SD is a decimal, it is hard to find the exact point under the standard normal curve.

## Z-scores:

The distance from the mean to the 1 on this standard normal curve is equal to the SD.

The distance from the mean to the 1 on this standard normal curve is equal to z=1.

## Z-scores:

### Find:

-   Z = 1
-   Z = -2
-   Z = 0.5

![](images/bell_prop2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Z-scores

Z-scores re-express the original data points (the X's) in a way that intuitively lets us know:

-   How close the X is to the mean (AKA how much this particular participant is like the average person in the sample)

-   Where it falls in the dispersion of the distribution (AKA how different this particular participant is from the majority of people in the sample)

## Calculating

### Z-scores

-   Subtract the mean from each X value.

-   Divide by the standard deviation.

$$
z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}
$$

## Z-scores

### Z-Scores are calculated by:

-   Centering the X values on the mean: When we center the mean (AKA mean-centering), we set the mean to 0.
-   Dividing by the standard deviation: When we divide by the SD, the space from the mean is expressed in standard deviations.

## Z-scores

```{r}
library(dplyr)
tibble(
  x = c(10,10,20,30,30),
  `x-xbar` = x-mean(x),
  `(x-xbar)^2` = (x-mean(x))^2
)
```

## Z-scores

$z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

$z = \frac{-10}{10}$

-   Sum of Squares = 400

-   Variance = 400/(5-1)

-   Standard Deviation = 10

```{r}
tibble(
  x = c(10,10,20,30,30),
  `x-xbar` = x-mean(x),
  `(x-xbar)^2` = (x-mean(x))^2,
  z = (x-mean(x))/sd(x)
)
```

## Z-scores

-   We made the mean = 0: When you mean-center a distribution, you shift it along the number line.

-   We made the SD = 1: When you divide a distribution by the SD, you shrink the distribution down.

-   **BUT: The shape of the distribution remains the same.**

## Z-scores

Shift distribution along the number line.

Shrink distribution down.

**The shape of the distribution remains the same.**

  tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  score = c(10,10,20,30,30)
) |> 
  ggplot(aes(score,id)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "\nExam Score",
       y = "Student\n")


p2 <- 
  tibble(
    id = 1:5,
    score = c(10,10,20,30,30),
    `x-xbar` = score - mean(score)

## Z-Scores

### Why Do We Care?

-   A z-score tells me where my score falls in SD units.

-   I can then look at this standard normal curve, and estimate what percentage of people did better or worse than me.

## Z-Scores

### Why Do We Care?

The mean score for Exam 1 was a 92 with a standard deviation of 3.

-   Esmeralda scored an 86.

-   What percent of the class scored better than Esmeralda?

$z=\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$

$z = \frac{86-92}{3} = -2$

-   86-92/3 = -2

-   98% of the class did better than Esmeralda.

## Z-Scores

### The mean score for Exam 1 was a 92 with a standard deviation of 3.

Jonas scored a 95.

-   What percent of the class scored better than Jonas?

$$
z = \frac{95-92}{3} = 1
$$

16% scored higher than Jonas.
